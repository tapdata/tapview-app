## Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Materialized Views in MongoDB

### Creating Materialized Views Using MongoDB Shell

The **MongoDB Shell** provides a [straightforward way to create](https://tapdata.io/data-engineering-resources/create-manage-materialized-views-mongodb/) materialized views. You can use the `db.createView()` method to define a view based on an aggregation pipeline. This method allows you to specify the source collection and the pipeline stages required to transform the data.

Here’s how you can create a materialized view using the MongoDB Shell:

1.  Open the MongoDB Shell and connect to your database.
2.  Use the `db.createView()` method with the following syntax:

    db.createView( "viewName", "sourceCollection", [aggregationPipeline] )

- Replace `"viewName"` with the name of your materialized view.

* Replace `"sourceCollection"` with the name of the collection you want to use as the data source.

* Replace `[aggregationPipeline]` with the stages of your aggregation pipeline.

For example, if you want to create a materialized view that calculates the total sales for each product, you can use:

    db.createView( "totalSalesView", "sales", [ { $group: { _id: "$ productId", totalSales: { $sum: "$ amount" } } } ] )

This command creates a materialized view named `totalSalesView` that stores precomputed sales data.

> "Using the MongoDB Shell gives you full control over the creation process, making it ideal for developers who prefer command-line tools."

### Creating Materialized Views Using MongoDB Compass

If you prefer a graphical interface, **MongoDB Compass** simplifies the process of creating materialized views. This tool is user-friendly and eliminates the need to write commands manually.

Follow these steps to create a materialized view in MongoDB Compass:

1.  Open MongoDB Compass and connect to your database.

2.  Navigate to the collection you want to use as the source for your materialized view.

3.  Click on the **Aggregation** tab to start building your aggregation pipeline.

4.  Add the necessary stages to your pipeline. For example, you can use `$group`, `$match`, or `$sort` to transform your data.

5.  Once your pipeline is ready, click on the **Export Pipeline to Language** button and select **JavaScript**.

6.  Use the exported code to create a materialized view in the MongoDB Shell, or save the results into a new collection using the `$merge` operator.

MongoDB Compass makes it easy to visualize your data transformations and ensures accuracy when defining complex pipelines.

### Joining Collections with Materialized Views

Joining collections in MongoDB often requires complex queries that can slow down performance. Materialized views simplify this process by precomputing and storing the results of joins. You can query the materialized view directly, avoiding the need to join collections in real time.

For example, if you manage an e-commerce platform, you might need to combine customer and order data to analyze purchasing behavior. Instead of running a query that joins these collections every time, you can create a materialized view that stores the combined data. This approach improves query performance and ensures consistent results.

Key benefits of using materialized views for joins include:

- **Reduced Complexity**: Precomputed joins simplify your queries, making them easier to write and maintain.

* **Improved Performance**: Materialized views eliminate the overhead of joining collections during query execution.

## Managing Materialized Views in MongoDB

[Managing materialized views](https://tapdata.io/data-engineering-resources/create-manage-materialized-views-mongodb/) in **MongoDB** ensures that your data remains accurate and relevant for your queries. Proper management involves updating and deleting materialized views based on your application’s needs. This section will guide you through these processes, helping you maintain efficiency and control over your database operations.

### Updating Materialized Views in MongoDB

Materialized views in **MongoDB** [do not update automatically](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.3/core/materialized-views/). You must [refresh materialized views manually](https://risingwave.com/blog/top-databases-for-advanced-materialized-views/) or schedule updates to ensure they reflect the latest data. This process is essential for maintaining accurate and up-to-date query results.

To refresh materialized views, you can use the `$merge` or `$out` stages in an aggregation pipeline. These stages allow you to overwrite the existing materialized view with updated data. For example, if you have a materialized view that aggregates daily sales data, you can run an updated aggregation pipeline at the end of each day to refresh the view.

Here’s how you can refresh materialized views using the `$merge` stage:

    db.sales.aggregate([ { $group: { _id: "$ productId", totalSales: { $sum: "$ amount" } } }, { $merge: "dailySalesView" } ]);

This command updates the `dailySalesView` collection with the latest aggregated sales data. You can automate this process by scheduling it to run at specific intervals, such as [daily or weekly](https://dev.to/ilinieja/mongodb-materialized-views-in-nodejs-mongoose-1593), depending on your requirements.

> "Refreshing materialized views ensures that your queries always retrieve the most relevant and accurate data."

For on-demand updates, you can trigger the refresh process whenever necessary. This approach is useful for scenarios where data changes unpredictably or requires immediate updates.

### Deleting Materialized Views in MongoDB

Deleting materialized views in **MongoDB** is straightforward since they are stored as regular collections. You can use the `db.collection.drop()` method to remove a materialized view when it is no longer needed. This action helps free up storage space and keeps your database organized.

To delete a materialized view, follow these steps:

1.  Open the **MongoDB** shell and connect to your database.

2.  Use the `db.collection.drop()` method with the name of the materialized view you want to delete. For example:

    db.dailySalesView.drop();

This command removes the `dailySalesView` collection from your database. Ensure that you no longer need the materialized view before deleting it, as this action cannot be undone.

> "Deleting unused materialized views helps optimize storage and maintain a clean database structure."

By managing materialized views effectively, you can maintain control over your database and ensure optimal performance. Regular updates keep your data accurate, while timely deletions prevent unnecessary storage consumption.
