In today’s fast-paced, data-driven world, businesses need real-time access to accurate data for faster decision-making. Migrating data from relational databases to MongoDB provides significant benefits like enhanced query performance, scalability, and real-time insights. MongoDB’s document-based model is perfect for handling large-scale data and delivering high-speed queries. Real-time materialized views in MongoDB are crucial as they store precomputed query results, ensuring data is always fresh and improving read performance.

TapView and MongoDB Relational Migrator (RM) are two of the most popular and powerful tools for real-time data migration and synchronization from RDBMS. TapView excels in creating real-time materialized views and integrating data from multiple sources—relational databases to MongoDB/Atlas, making it ideal for both complex and simple use cases.

MongoDB RM is a robust solution designed mostly for one time database migration from RDBMS to MongoDB.

# **What is TapView?**

**TapView**, is a tool designed for real-time heterogeneous data synchronization and creating materialized views from relational databases (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, eg..) to MongoDB/Atlas. It ensures these materialized views are updated in real-time, keeping the data in MongoDB synchronized with the source databases using the built-in CDC (Change Data Capture) feature.

A key feature of TapView is its ability to integrate data from multiple relational databases into a single materialized view. TapView also includes a number of common data processing nodes. These nodes allow you to filter data, adding/deleting fields, perform lookups, and use a JavaScript node for more complex transformations before writing the data to MongoDB. This ensures that the data in your materialized view is exactly how you need it.

## **TapView’s Key Features**

1.  ### **Support Major Relational** **Database Connectors**

TapView supports over 10 data sources, making it an excellent solution for enterprises with diverse data architectures. These sources include:

- **Relational Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, SayBase, MariaDB.

* **NoSQL Databases:** MongoDB and MongoDB Atlas.

* **In-Memory Databases:** Redis

- **Distributed Data Streaming Platforms:** Kafka
- **File Formats:** CSV

2.  ### **Real-Time Materialized Views with Multi-Source Integration**

TapView is designed to create real-time updated materialized views from multiple relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server). Unlike traditional views, which only provide static data when queried, materialized views store query results in a physical table, greatly improving read performance. TapView continuously refreshes and updates these views using built-in CDC (Change Data Capture) connectors, ensuring that MongoDB/Atlas remains synchronized with the latest data from the source systems.

What sets TapView apart is its ability to integrate data from multiple databases into a single unified materialized view. This allows you to consolidate data from various sources, such as customer information from multiple databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, DB2), into one cohesive MongoDB collection. This data aggregation simplifies complex workflows and provides real-time access to consolidated data, enabling better decision-making.

3.  ### **Schema Mapping from Relational databases to NoSql Database Migration**

TapView offers robust schema mapping capabilities to convert relational database schemas into MongoDB's flexible document-based model.

- **Manual Schema Mapping**: Users can manually map relational database schemas to MongoDB using Tapview user friendly interface. This includes the ability to define how related tables (one-to-one or one-to-many relationships) should be represented in MongoDB.

* **Embedded Objects and Arrays**: TapView can write related tables or child tables into MongoDB as embedded objects or arrays. For instance:

- **One-to-One Relationships**: Data from the related table can be embedded as a sub-document in the parent record.

  - **One-to-Many Relationships**: Data from the child table can be written as an array of embedded objects, ensuring MongoDB collections adhere to best practices for denormalized document design.

4.  ### **Built-in Data Processing Nodes for Data Transformation**

One of the standout features of TapView is its extensive set of **built-in data processing nodes**, which enable data transformations before writing to the target MongoDB/Atlas materialized view. These data processing nodes offer capabilities such as **adding or removing fields**, **data cleansing**, and **complex transformations** using custom JavaScript scripts in the JS data processing node. These data processing nodes enable a variety of data transformations, making it easier to manage and manipulate data as it flows from source systems to materialized views in MongoDB.

5.  ### Low-Coding, User-Friendly Interface

TapView is designed with an intuitive, low-code interface, which makes it easier to set up and manage complex data pipelines. Even without extensive coding knowledge, users can quickly design data flows, set up real-time synchronization, and create materialized views—all with minimal effort. This makes TapView suitable for both end users and data analysts.

# **MongoDB Relational Migrator (RM)**

MongoDB Relational Migrator (RM) is a powerful tool designed for real-time data migration from relational databases to MongoDB, offering capabilities to map relational schemas into MongoDB's flexible document-based structure.

In addition to migrating data, **MongoDB RM** also supports **basic data transformations**. Users can map fields between relational tables and MongoDB documents, modify data types, and add or remove fields during the migration process. These transformations are relatively straightforward but allow users to adapt relational data to MongoDB’s document model more effectively. Monogdb RM Supports below major relational databases.

- SQL Server

* MySql

* PostgreSql

* Oracle

* Db2 (Preview)

* Sybase ASE (Preview)

## **Key Features of MongoDB RM:**

1.  ### **Relational Database Migration:**

      MongoDB RM specializes in migrating data from relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and more. It is optimized for real-time data migration from relational database sources to MongoDB.

2.  ### **Schema Mapping:**

      It provides the ability to map relational database schemas to MongoDB’s flexible document model. Users can define how data from relational tables is translated into MongoDB collections, maintaining the integrity of the data while leveraging MongoDB's document-based structure.

3.  ### **Basic Data Transformation:**

      MongoDB RM allows basic data transformations, such as mapping fields from relational tables to MongoDB's documents, adding or removing fields, and simple data type conversions.

4.  ### **Real Time Data** **Processing:**

      MongoDB RM enables real-time synchronization between relational databases and MongoDB using Change Data Capture (CDC). It continuously captures changes from the source relational database and applies them to MongoDB in real time, ensuring data consistency.
